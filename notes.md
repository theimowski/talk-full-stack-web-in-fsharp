# Notes

## In advance

* Release slides (newest version)
* Prepare fall-back steps (dirs)
* Deploy test app to azure

## Just before talk

* Terminal
  * Make sure I got the `dotnet new SAFE` command right

* Chrome browser:
  * Double check internet connection - speedtest.net
  * Open conf vendor logo in browser to copy url: http://ihsgdansk.com/images/aktualnosci/devsharp2016/devsharp.png
  * Prepare https://portal.azure.com
  * Prepare http://GoQr.me

* VS Code:
  * Open directory (after creating from template),
  * Hide menu bar,
  * Hide activity,
  * Hide status bar (Toggle visibility)
  * Open a different window with steps.md just in case

* Chrome app window:
  * https://applicationize.me/now -> chrome://apps -> SAFE
  * Side by side ~2/3 so that app goes mobile mode

* Start timer

## Customize

### UI

* Logo - Style [ Width 200; Border "2px solid" ] 
* Title: "Dev# '18"

* C (C#)
* A (ASP.NET)
* S (Sql Server)
* T (typescript)

---

### Dev# GdaÅ„sk

* Audience - most not familiar with F#
* F# Slide - assume audience knows C#, so make comparisons; Syntax is not important - pay attention to semantics
* 50min compared to 45min in London
* Don't code everything - use snippets (save time)
* Deploy to azure in one go (save time)
* Skip "See Scores" (save time)

Plan:

* 30.08
  * 1 notes
  * 2 trial
  * 1 notes
* 31.08
  * 2 notes
  * 2 trial
* 19.09
  * 1 trial just code
  * 1 notes
  * 2 trial
* 20.09
  * 1 backup
  * 1 final notes
  * 2 final trial

### F# Exchange

* Watch video from Lambda Days and write down notes
* What to change compared to Lambda Days?

* Different audience - can assume most are familiar with F#
* Mention other talks during F# Exchange on the topic (Elmish talk comes before mine)

* Saturn?
* Azure functions?
* https://twitter.com/sforkmann/status/969565080768655360 server side rendering ?


## Creating SAFE project

* Create dir
* `dotnet new -i SAFE.Template`
* `dotnet new SAFE --Fulma --Remoting`
* `code .`
* `build run`
* While the build is running, tell more about Fulma and Remoting, and about project structure

## Architecture

* Shared code - counter type + Fable.Remoting - not restful, but just fine for our case
* Server side - how init counter works, webpart
* Client side - all compiled to fable, elmish architecture explained

## Building form 

* model init update in App.fs
* Replace "SAFE Template" with "SAFE Demo"
* Replace safeComponents with "Score the talk"
* Remove safeComponents
* Add logo: Level.level -> Level.item -> Image.image -> img (imgSrc depending on context)
* (git history)
* define onInput wih JsInterop; add comment to model4
* add model to name
* place some text in input to show that HMR preserves state

## Client side debugging

* Console trace
* Redux-devtools (Time-travel debugger)
* React-devtools - is outlined on smileys

## Talking to server side 

* Submitting vote - disabling controls on Loading
* Adding protocol to Fable.Remoting
* Server refresh (dotnet watch)
* Firing request in Client side
* Displaying results

## Deploy

* script, but also F# with FAKE
* bundle - publish server, collect client
* start docker-machine
* build docker
* run in docker -  `docker run -d -p 8085:8085 --rm --name safe-demo-test -it theimowski/safe-demo`
* login to docker (do before demo)
* deploy to docker hub
* azure - create new web app for container
* map port 8085 to 80 `az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group safe-demo --name safe-demo --settings WEBSITES_PORT=8085`
* think of something to say when the contianer is warming up

Agenda :

* Brief intro
* Tech Stack
  * Suave.IO
  * (Azure)?
  * Fable
  * Elmish
  * React
  * Redux time travel debugger
  * Fulma (Bulma)
  * F#
* dotnet new SAFE 
* `build run` - while running, explain stuff

---

To show:

* Explain Elm-architecture
 
* HMR

* Console trace
* Redux-devtools (time travel debugger)
* React-devtools (for better UI debugging) ? - what fancy can you do with that?

---

* Server refresh
* Shared code
* Server-side + client-side validation
* Debugging server side?
* Web App for Containers (Docker) - do manually, not from template?

* Deploying to Docker Hub + Azure - takes time, spend it to show some slides
* http://goqr.me/
* 
* ?Azure Storage

To resolve:

* Displaying comments together with name

* Writing comment on mobile with autocorrect -strange things happen
* Leave out disabling inputs?

* Pin paket so that it does not get updated?
* Pin packages so that they do not get updated?

* Old version of docker installed "system root pool not available on Windows"
* Template - view in separate file?
